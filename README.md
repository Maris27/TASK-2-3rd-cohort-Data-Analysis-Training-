INTRODUCTION TO TASK 2(PRACTICING FOUNCTIONS AND FORMULAR)

After the trainig session on how to use functions and formular by Promise Chinonso ,we were assigned a task which is part of the learning process to ensure we understood what has beeen taught.

we were given a data set known as Sales Data,we were assigned to carry the following using the data set provided.

1. We were asked to determine the total Revenue and profit generated 

2. Determine the average Revenue and unit sold for every order

3. Calculate the total discount given in $

4. Determine the number of sales recorded

5. Calculate the highest profit generated.

6. Creating a column named sales return to ascertain high sales or low sales of the sales entries.


  DATA SET PROVIDED.

    ACTIVITIES

    1. To determine Total revenue and proift generated,i used the sum function to sum the range that meant my criteria.
    
    Total revenue =sum(J2:J701) these stands s the range for sales which also means Revenue ,while total profit =sum(K2:K701) this stands as the for profit

    2.In other to get the average revenue and unit sold for every order ,i used the Average function.=Average(range)

    Average revenue =Average(J2:J701) 
    
    Average unit sold =AVERAGE(E2:E701)

    3.calulating the total discount given, i used the sum function i.e =sum(Range) to sum the total discount on the data set

    =SUM((I2:I701) and i changed the number format from general to currency,then selected the dollar sign.

    4.To ascertain this i used the count function =count((range),to count the total number of sales entry

    =COUNT(J2:J701) this is the range that meant my criteria

    5.I Used a function known as Max =max(range),with this i was able to get the highest profit generated.

    =MAX(K2:K701)
